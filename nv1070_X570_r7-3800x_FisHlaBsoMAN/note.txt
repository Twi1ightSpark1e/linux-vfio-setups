I passthrough Nvidia GTX1070 VGA on first primary PCI-E X16 slot. My secondary slot only has X4 lines. 
I disable efifb on kernel commandline and use vesafb. My UEFI not support switch primary gpu in settings. If i use efifb - my VGA for VM doesn't initializating on guest system.
In secondary slot AMD RX560 using by host Linux.
For audio I use HDMI. 
For mouse & kbd - second mouse & synergy
